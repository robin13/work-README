I am often vocal in my opinion that incentive schemes are not good - this page is the summary of my opinions and related articles.

What is a bonus / incentive scheme?
Here are some which exist at Elastic:

Sales people having a percentage of salary resulting from sales volume
Outstanding Contribution Award / Elasticlub
Why are bonus / incentive schemes bad?
It has been proven time and time again that any monetary compensation above a basic wage does very little to motivate to extra heights, so using incentives as a "carrot" does not work.  Conversely it is very difficult to create an incentive scheme which benefits the company and the recipient in equal measure on success.  For example having a correlation for a sales person between their turnover and personal income may (we have seen this many times at Elastic) cause them to do actions which are good for them personally, but not the best for Elastic or the customer - this includes actions such as:

closing a deal on a particular date because it is better to get it in that month
selling more than the customer really needs because they are a bit gullible
not making an effort to sell a certain product because the percentages on it are not worth it
After-the-fact bonus holds other dangers - there is always going to be a watermark to divide those who receive and those who do not.  Drawing lines of any kind splits teams, and while the intention may be to praise one person for the extra work they did, it also highlights that others have not worked quite so much putting a negative light on their achievements.  It can also cause the individuals singled out for a bonus to feel shameful when in contact with their not-winning colleagues and result in a divide in a team where before the team was strong together.

Individual bonuses based on voting or other subjective metrics will favour high-visibility users, not necessarily those who made the difference: one individual will get the bonus while 8 people who collectively achieved much much more may go un-noticed.
